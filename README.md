#  Dyno-bookmark-hack

I was made aware by a YouTuber [No Text To Speech](https://www.youtube.com/c/NoTextToSpeech) about a hack going around Discord [from their video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0emiy4TxV7A). This repository **1)** contains **a)** the original source code, **b)** a deobfuscated and reformatted version of the code, and **c)** a rewritten non-malicious version of the code; and **2)** documents how the hack works.

*Note: the hack involves a feature of Dyno configured by an attacker. The bot and its creator(s) are not to blame here, and not this repository nor the aforementioned video is trying to throw shade at them whatsoever.*
